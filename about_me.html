								<h3>Early Days</h3>
								<p>This bio begins my shift from a career in touring theatrical Stage-Management to Programming, just like everyone else these days, am I right? It may sound peculiar, but there are several areas where my expertise in one help me in the other.<br><br>

									I am shifting into a new career from an old one. I had spent more than half of my life organizing and operating large-scale musicals, as one of around 50 total stage managers in the country on the highest-tiered contract. After finally spending time off from the schedule during covid, I realized it is time to channel my drive and passion into a career that I can love, and one who will let me finally unpack my suitcases.<br><br>
									
									Being a stage manager is more than pencil-pushing and rehearsing, far more. There is a live component, chief amongst them is the SM "calling" the show. I would sit with a copy of the script, and follow along line by line. I would read cues to stagehands, sound operators, musicians, etc., so the cues will execute on the same beat of music, or line of text, seamlessly and organically together. There is an art in performance, and calling is how a I contributed to my art. <br><br>
									
									That's the beautiful side. The side that pays the bills is how well you can solve a problem when things are, maybe literally, on fire, and you don't want 2,500 paying customers to know. I have managed over 7000 live performances, and I can count on one hand the number that went without incident. Time and Murphy's Laws have both tested me in impossible, and sometimes hilarious ways, but I have learned the importance of triage. To slow down moments, and parse through complex problems into safety, then how can we best maintain the integrity of the show, who needs to know first, amongst several million other things. That is the kind of clear-headed thinking and organizing I am excited to bring a development company now!<br><br>
									
									Finally, I am excited to be part of a team again. I'm paraphrasing, but Margaret Mead once said that a small group of smart, good-hearted individuals can change the world. I have been the part of changing peoples' lives for many years through theatre, I would just like to do it a different way now.</p>
