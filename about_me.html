								<h3>Early Days</h3>
								<p>This bio begins my shift from a career in touring theatrical Stage-Management to Programming, just like everyone else these days, am I right?<br><br>

									I am shifting into a new career from an old one. I had spent more than half of my life organizing and operating large-scale touring musicals, as a stage manager on the highest-tiered contracts available. After finally spending time off from the schedule during covid, I realized it is time to channel my motivation into a career that I can love, and one that will let me finally unpack my suitcases.<br><br>
									
									There are several instances where the expertise from my old career informs my programming today. Programming allows me to be creative in ways I wouldn’t have imagined, while still being focused on the details. Code can be used to develop any project in nearly any direction I choose! It’s engaging, this feeling of boundless potential in scope that requires exacting specificity in code. I enjoy parsing details of things, and now I’m doing it for a living, and that is very cool.<br><br>
									
									Being a stage manager was more than pencil-pushing and rehearsing, far more. The side that pays the bills is how well you can solve a problem when things are, maybe literally, on fire, and you don't want 2,500 paying customers to know. I’m not 100% unflappable, I’ve definitely flapped, but years of triage and live-decomposition make me a cool head under pressure.<br><br>
									
									I have managed over 7000 live performances, and speaking to large groups of people, respectfully and honestly, was totally a daily part of the job. For example, I would routinely read names of standbys and understudies over a microphone to several thousand audience members before a show to indicate a cast change. If it ever came up, speaking in front of others is comfortable to me.<br><br>
									
									Finally, I am very excited to be part of a team again. I work very well alone, but I enjoy collaborating towards a similar goal with others. The entire nature of theatre is predicated on the idea of individuals coming together to do something much bigger than themselves. Margaret Mead said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”  With such powerful tools at our disposal, we have the ability to do good things well, and a team that works well together is unstoppable.</p>
